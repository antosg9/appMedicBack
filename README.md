## üéâ Welcome

Welcome to the **AppMedic** backend, an application designed to report essential medicines in case of supply difficulties.

Here is the link to the frontend project: [AppMedicFront](https://github.com/paulpp78/AppMedicFront)

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure that Docker is installed on your machine. Alternatively, you can use a local Python environment if preferred.

   ```

Your backend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

5. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

6. Start the application:

   ```bash
   flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=3000
   ```

Your backend application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Ensure all necessary configurations (such as environment variables) are set. You can create a `.env` file in the root directory with the required configurations.
